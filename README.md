Palette_Bot is a Reddit bot that generates a color palette for images it is called upon. The sizes of each color in the palette image are proportionate to thier dominance in the input image. Image/color processing is handled by a fork of the [Haishoku](https://www.github.com/LanceGin/Haishoku) Library, which I've modified to work with this bot ([Haishoku-mod](https://github.com/JoshuaScript/haishoku-mod)).
